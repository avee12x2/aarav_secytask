# Problem Statement
## Enchanted IIT

Hermione, a dear friend of yours, is a student at Enchanted IIT, a magical institute renowned for its wizardry and witchcraft. She has recently completed her first year at the institute and is now ready to begin her second year. However, she must first deal with a peculiar situation.

As happens every year, the students move from their old hostels to new ones, and the challenge of reallocating students to different rooms arises. Being the house representative for Gryffindor, Hermione has been tasked with this responsibility by the House Headmaster. The task is as follows:

In a single wing, she has to allocate rooms and roommates to nnn students. The wing consists of x triple rooms and y double rooms such that 3x+2y=n. This equation ensures that there will be no empty places after every student has been allocated a room. Being the kind-hearted person that Hermione is, she asks each of the nnn students for their preference regarding their preferred roommate.

However, as she begins working on the problem of finding the best possible arrangement that would satisfy the greatest number of students, she realizes it would take too much of her time and that she would not be able to complete the task on time. So, she turns to you for help.

Your task, for a particular wing, is to determine the maximum number of students that can be satisfied by an arrangement.
